         <h1>Windsor Mayoral Election 2014</h1>
		 <p>(This content can also be viewed at http://www.scweb.ca/~w0668955/ch/election/election2014.html)</p>
         <p>The city of Windsor held  Municipal Election on October 27, 2014. 12 candidates entered the mayoral race. 58770 residents in 103 polls cast their ballots in this mayoral race. The participation rate was 37.46%.
		 </p>
		
		 <p>
Drew Dilkens almost dominated the race. In 10 wards and advance voting, he captured more than 50 % of votes, except in Ward 2 and in Ward 3 where he took home respectively 40% and 43% of votes. In his home ward, ward 1, he won as high as 65% of  votes! Also in advance voting, his leading was quite impressive, winning 61% of votes. On average  he got 55.5% of total votes and became a new mayor of city of Windsor.
</p>
		
		 <p>
The other candidate, John Millson, left far behind Drew Dilkens. His best performance was in Ward 2, winning 38% of votes while Dilkens’ worst performance was 40% of votes in Ward 2, which was still better than John Millson’s best performance!
</p>
		
		 <p>
The real race was actually running between Drew Dilkens and John Millson. Of 10 other candidates, only Larry Horwitz was worth mentioning. In most of wards, his performance was always under 20 % of votes. His best performance was in Ward 3 where he got 18.8% of votes. Besides the 3 candidates mentioned above, all other candidates got only less than 10% of votes each, many of them even less than 2  % of votes!
It seems that Drew Dilken was a big winner in this mayoral race. The only regret is that the participation rate was just too low, only 37%!
